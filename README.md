# Emotion Based Music Recommendation

This project, a facial expression-driven music recommender system for emotion recognition, aimed at discerning user emotions and proposing appropriate songs. Upon recognizing a user's emotional state, the system tailors a playlist accordingly. This emotion detection model is trained on the Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition dataset, whereas the music player dataset consists of some random songs. Implementation of facial emotion detection leverages a Convolutional Neural Network, delivering an accuracy of approximately 95%. Additionally, song prediction employs Linear Regression, enhancing the system's predictive capabilities.

# The songs in this folder are for the sake of references only 
--- You can try it out with your own playlist --- 

The process comprises five sequential steps:
1. Upload Image
2. Preprocessing
3. Training
4. Emotion Recognition
5. Predict the Music
